Exploratory analysis on Disturbance storm time (Dst) Index.

## What is Disturbance storm time (Dst)?
The Dst index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic activity at a given time. It has a temporal resolution of 1 hour and in simple terms it is a number showing how disturbed space weather is. Dst index is available for free download from the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto.
